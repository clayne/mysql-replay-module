# A TCPCopy module for MySQL Replay

The mysql-replay-module is a TCPCopy extension designed to replay MySQL sessions, enabling real-world testing of MySQL applications.

For detailed information, please consult [TCPCopy](https://github.com/session-replay-tools/tcpcopy) before proceeding.

## Installation

### Installing `intercept` on the Assistant Server
1. git clone git://github.com/session-replay-tools/intercept.git
2. cd intercept
3. ./configure --with-resp-payload
4. make
5. make install


### Installing `tcpcopy` on the Online Server
1. git clone git://github.com/session-replay-tools/tcpcopy.git
2. cd tcpcopy
3. git clone git://github.com/session-replay-tools/mysql-replay-module.git
4. ./configure --set-protocol-module=mysql-replay-module
5. make
6. make install


## Usage Guide
 
### 1. **On the Target Server Running MySQL Applications:**

Configure the route commands to direct response packets to the assistant server. For example, assuming `10.110.12.18` is the IP address of the assistant server and `10.110.12.15` is the MySQL client IP address, use the following route command to direct all responses from `10.110.12.15` to the assistant server:

   `route add -host 10.110.12.15 gw 10.110.12.18`

### 2. **On the Assistant Server Running `intercept` (Root Privilege or CAP_NET_RAW Capability Required):**

  `./intercept -F <filter> -i <device>`

   Note that the filter format is the same as the pcap filter. For example:

   `./intercept -i eth0 -F 'tcp and src port 3306' -d`

   In this example, `intercept` will capture response packets from a TCP-based application listening on port 3306, using the eth0 network device.
 
### 3. **On the Online Source Server (Root Privilege or CAP_NET_RAW Capability Required):**

a) Configure user password pairs in `conf/plugin.conf` within the installation directory.

Format:

`user user1@password1,user2@password2,...,userN@passwordN;`

For example:

`user root@123456;`
        
b) To start `tcpcopy`, use the following command:

`./tcpcopy -x localServerPort-targetServerIP:targetServerPort -s <intercept server> [-c <ip range>]`

For example (assuming 10.110.12.17 is the IP address of the target server):

`./tcpcopy -x 3306-10.110.12.17:3306 -s 10.110.12.18`

`tcpcopy` captures MySQL packets (assuming MySQL listens on port 3306) on the current server, modifies them as needed, and forwards them to port 3306 on `10.110.12.17` (the target MySQL server). It also connects to `10.110.12.18` to request that `intercept` forwards the response packets to it.

   

## Note
1. User Accounts and Privileges: Both MySQL instances on the target and online servers must have identical user accounts and privileges, though passwords can differ.
2. Session Replay: Only complete sessions can be replayed.
3. OpenSSL Support: OpenSSL 1.1.0+ is not currently supported.
4. Password Plugin Compatibility: MySQL 8.0â€™s caching_sha2_password is not supported. To test MySQL 8.0 using MySQL 5.7 production flows, use mysql_native_password and ensure that all users involved in the test are configured with the mysql_native_password plugin.
